Tools Needed:
- Docker
- Kind

Docker install can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Kind install can be found [here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)


Steps
1. Deploy Kind Cluster with ingress enabled
2. Explore StatefulSets
3. Deploy Kubernetes Services
4. Deploy an Ingress Controller
5. Service Mesh 

We will explore these Kubernetes Networking Abstractions
StatefulSets

Services
- NodePort
- Cluster
- LoadBalancer
- Endpoints
- Endpoint Slices

Ingress
- Ingress Controller
- Ingress rules

Service Mesh
- Linkerd
- Istio

# Step 1. Deploy Kind Cluster with ingress enabled

With the kind cluster configuration yaml, we can use kind to create that cluster with the below command. If this is the first time running it, it will take some time to download all the docker images for the working and control plane docker images.

```bash

```
# Step 2. Explore StatefulSets

# Step 3. Deploy Kubernetes Services

# Step 4. Deploy an Ingress Controller

# Step 5. Service Mesh
